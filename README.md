Job execution framework

Working as a responsible for job management in a financial institution I created a perl script that could execute scripts in a certain order determined by their names. It was soon used as a general addition to control-m jobs and to carry out installations. It was so successful that I decided to create a go version for me (and you). The new version is a complete reimplementation of the concepts found in the script, not just a translation. It would have been wasted time to just translate the script without taking into account what we learned by the application of it by its users.

More to follow soon...

I also plan to create a jobmanagement tool based on this tool...
